# Day 1: LLM Engineering Learning

## What are LLMs (Large Language Models)?

LLMs are powerful machine learning models designed to understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They have become fundamental to numerous applications in natural language processing (NLP), including text generation, summarization, translation, and question answering. LLMs are typically based on the **transformer architecture**, which utilizes attention mechanisms to process and generate language.

### Key Concepts:
- **Large Language Models** (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of textual data to capture patterns in language.
- **Transformers** are the core architecture behind LLMs, leveraging the attention mechanism to efficiently handle large sequences of text.

### Techniques to Scale LLM Applications:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** ‚Äì Improve LLMs with external knowledge sources.
- **Fine-Tuning & LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** ‚Äì Customize models for domain-specific tasks.
- **Prompt Engineering & Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** ‚Äì Optimize query responses.
- **Quantization (GPTQ, AWQ, GGUF)** ‚Äì Run large models efficiently on small hardware.

### Examples of LLMs:
- **GPT-3/4** (Generative Pretrained Transformers)
- **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- **T5**, **RoBERTa**, **XLNet**  
- **Frontier models** are cutting-edge, large-scale AI models designed to push the limits of AI capabilities. Examples include GPT-4, Gemini 1.5, and Claude 3.5.

## 1. Introduction to LLMs

LLMs are designed to handle various tasks in NLP. These models learn to predict the next word in a sequence, thereby learning language structure, context, and meaning. LLMs are **pretrained** on massive text corpora and can be fine-tuned for specific applications.
  
### Running Large Language Models Locally

1. **Hardware Requirements**: You need a GPU with sufficient VRAM (e.g., 16GB+ for large models like LLaMA, GPT-NeoX, etc.) or multiple CPU cores if running on a CPU.
2. **Software**: Install CUDA for GPU support, and PyTorch or TensorFlow for the model's backend.
3. **Memory Consideration**: For large models, you may need to use quantized models (e.g., GPTQ) or memory-efficient tools (e.g., Hugging Face's accelerate library).
4. **Use Open-Source Models**: Hugging Face provides pretrained models for local inference: Transformers. Ollama, vLLM, and LM Studio are tools to facilitate LLMs locally.

## 2. How LLMs Work

LLMs operate on text sequences and use attention mechanisms to determine which words are important in a given context. The **transformer model** relies on a "self-attention" mechanism that allows it to consider the entire sequence of words at once, making it more efficient for processing long text compared to traditional models.

### Architecture Breakdown:
- **Encoder**: Encodes the input text into numerical representations.
- **Decoder**: Generates output sequences based on the encoded information.
- **Self-attention layers**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence.

## 3. Pretraining and Fine-Tuning

- **Pretraining**: LLMs are initially trained on vast datasets containing diverse text from the internet. This helps the model learn language structure and common patterns in various languages.
- **Fine-Tuning**: After pretraining, LLMs are fine-tuned on domain-specific data to specialize in certain tasks (e.g., medical text, legal language, etc.).

## 4. Applications of LLMs

LLMs have revolutionized NLP tasks such as:
- **Text Summarization**: Condensing long documents into shorter summaries.
- **Text Generation**: Automatically generating text, such as stories or articles.
- **Question Answering**: Answering questions based on a given context.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text.
- **Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.

## OpenAI API and Tools

### OpenAI's GPT Models:
- **GPT-3** and **GPT-4** are state-of-the-art models developed by OpenAI that have set the standard for LLMs in terms of language generation and comprehension.
  
### Hugging Face Transformers:
- **Hugging Face** provides open-source access to various LLMs like GPT, BERT, and others. It also includes an easy-to-use interface for loading and fine-tuning models.

### LangChain:
- **LangChain** is a framework that makes it easy to build applications using LLMs. It provides support for chaining together different LLMs, tools, and APIs for more complex workflows.

### Tools for Implementation:
- **Gradio**: A Python library to quickly create web interfaces for machine learning models.
- **Streamlit**: A framework to build machine learning and data science apps in Python.
- **BeautifulSoup**: A Python library for web scraping, often used for extracting text from HTML content.
